## Overview
Simple implementations of three well-known encryption algorithms: DES (Data Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), and Blowfish.

## Contents
 - Blowfish.py: Implementation of the Blowfish encryption algorithm (Works with files).
 - DES.py: Implementation of the DES encryption algorithm (Works with files).
 - RSA.py: Implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm (only console text messages).
 - app.py: Simple menu to choose the algorithm to be used.

## Requirements
- Install sympy for the RSA algorithm

## How to run

- run ```python3 app.py```
